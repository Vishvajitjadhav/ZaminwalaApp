# 🏠 Zameenwala – Real Estate Backend 

Zameenwala is a **scalable real estate backend platform** built using **.NET, ASP.NET Core, and C#**, designed to power a property buying and selling ecosystem similar to platforms like **99acres**. This project focuses on **Clean Architecture**, **maintainable code**, and **real-world backend design**, making it suitable for enterprise and product-based applications.

Zameenwala provides **RESTful APIs** for managing property listings, users, and real estate transactions. The backend is designed to be **frontend-agnostic**, allowing seamless integration with web or mobile clients. The project demonstrates how to build a **production-ready backend system** using modern .NET best practices and scalable architectural principles.
